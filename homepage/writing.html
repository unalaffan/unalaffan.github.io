                <h1> Junkie Spirit</h1>
                <h2> By: Una Laffan </h2>
                <p class="ep">
                    <p> My city that never slept stared across the street from me on my first day in my home. It was full of life and party people; it was ugly and brash and a little scary; it kept me up all night with its flashing lights, introducing itself to my juvenile eyes. And it spoke, it told me that it was my “home.” I refused to believe it. It wasn't my life. My home was this brownstone; my home was my white nuclear family. I was from Carroll Gardens. I lived in the safety of my ballet studio and that fancy cookie shop, where it was 100 dollars for a cupcake. It called out to me again, it told me:
                    </p>
                    <p> “I am Brooklyn, the very spirit and therefore your home.”
                        “No you're not,” I yelled back, ``Brooklyn is my playgrounds; Brooklyn is biking in Prospect Park; Brooklyn is Dumbo, you're not Brooklyn you're gross.” And it laughed.
                    </p>
                    <p>“That's what they all say. You’ll see in time child. I am Beautiful.” I didn't like this unsleeping gross beauty. My family agreed, dreaming how our New neighborhood would be better without it. We agreed it wasn't our Brooklyn. I still looked from my bedroom window each night. I examined the party people that my mom called the police on. They all laughed for moments before returning to their thoughtless dance, all limp in their funny clothes. It’s lights yelling “DELI DELI DELI,” all through the night, flashing onto the unconscious people tumbling like fouls.
                    </p>
                    <p> I felt entitled to hate these Neighbors. I soon discovered that they were the problem in the neighborhood, the part not shown at the open house. Kiki was a hooker that hung out around my corner, grabbing drugs between her next customers. The six-foot tall scary man, a constant on the deli corner, was in charge of the block and each thing sold there. And of course there were the regular junkies, filling the street with their bags of clothes and discarded mattresses, committing public indecency on the daily. They were dangerous criminals that my life could go without. They didn’t even need to be people, I didn’t need their stories. I knew their truth without any knowledge of their lives. In my New York, they were bad guys and I was a good guy.
                    </p>
                    <p> I saw them as a lesson of what my life should never be: a “don't-do-drug-kids" poster come to life in front of me. Never end up like that; never be a no good lazy junkie taking down the neighborhood. I remember the drug presentations, if you smoke one cigarette or god forbid the devil’s lettuce your life shall be ruined and you'll drop out of high school and sell your body to get your next hit. It was all sin to me, all laziness and mistakes, no need for more explanation. I scowled at the intoxicated sadness that sat before me. Their lives’ problems seemed so simple and avoidable. A superiority complex was born in me. The four corners of my streets held my standards clear before me with a church facing the deli. My god stared at my new junkies and criminals through the stained glass windows. My opposing environments and the physical space between them. My corner cultured by junkies watched as Kiki met her next customer. The stairs on the stoop next door glowed with lighten cigs. Jesus sat behind his newly painted gate, his sculpted walls, his green curated bushes, and stained glass windows, doing nothing.</p>
                    <p>I dismissed them convinced that their habits were the problems in my life. I felt my life had been impacted by them. My friends didn't come over because I didn't want them to think my home was scary. I was scared myself, in the corners of my own street. Kiki and her friends threw their discarded needle caps into my front yard. They made my life hard; they made me insecure. They were my adversity. I hungered for the streets of Manhattan, the crowded buildings and the lack of personalness. I needed the rich, dulled down version of the duality; I wanted the other half. I wanted the rich private school Manhattan. I wanted to be rid of Brooklyn. If I had it my way, then I would have been marching down the streets of Soho brushing the dirt of Brooklyn off my shoes. That was a whole other life that I wished to lead in New York; a whole other section that I claimed as my own separating myself from my neighborhood and the dangers of it. My middle school outlook was that if no one at school ever saw my neighborhood then it didn't need to be my New York. My neighborhood didn't need to be connected to my life or how people saw me. I could be a Lululemon wearing Union Square girl if I wanted to. I heard them laughing. Look at my long, perfectly styled hair, my contoured, shaded makeup and $1000 joggers and matching bra. I am clearly happier than you. But no matter how much I wanted their perfect sex in the city pinterest board lives, I would get them. I would still have my deli </p>
                    <p> The Deli personified the difference between the life my parents wanted and the one we actually had. We are a middle class family that owns a brownstone in Brooklyn. In a cheaper city, my sister and I would be attending a private school in a safe neighborhood and we’d ride our little bikes home to our big house in a fancy neighborhood; we’d be safe and likely fucking boring. We wouldn’t develop personalities until college; and I wouldn’t know anything about myself. My parents don't exactly see it that way. Coming from smaller cities themselves, they cannot fully grasp how they are still deeply small-town people. Their childhood was the sweet life I just described of safety and childhood dreams–riding bikes and playing ‘til dark on long green lawns. My childhood was my dirty Lower East Side school life and my up and coming Bed Stuy Clinton Hill combo. Each day I waved goodbye to my consistent home junkies, heading to school, passing people shooting up on the street on the way–a beautiful dream scene of dead rats, filth and drugs: who could want more for their 10 year old? My parents could not escape the true, gritty, and scary New York that sat at our front door.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Are you ashamed of me?” The deli asked softly. I paused, was it mocking me?
                        “Yes. And why should I not be. You're ugly, the ugliest thing in my neighborhood. You're a home for the worst people here, for criminals. If you weren't here this would be a nice neighborhood, a clean one. Of course of course I’m FUCKING ASHAMED” I spat back.
                        “And what about your rich friends? Are you ashamed of them? What about yourself? ”
                        “What.” How dare it, “My friends are amazing, why would I be ashamed. And don't talk to me about myself it's you-”
                    </p>
                    <p> “The things you idolize are embarrassing. God that's a fine high horse. You think your friends have any idea what New York is like or what life is like. You want so badly to be rid of me that you cannot even acknowledge the fact that I am a part of your life. I am part of you growing up, part of your personality. I'm a far bigger part of you than Central Park or Soho. These Junkies you call criminals are simply people down on. They're mostly homeless. And you sit in your house and judge them. You try living their lives then come back and give me your perspective oh wise one. Just because you can’t Instagram pictures with something doesn't make it ugly. Life is complicated, people cannot always be strong and that is the promise of New York. That we would give compassion and receive empathy from our fellow new yorkers. That we would keep each other strong. Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
                        I bowed my head.
